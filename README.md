# üíñ Aura: Your Supportive Peer Mentor

Aura is a conversational AI peer mentor designed to be a safe and supportive space for users to share what's on their minds. Powered by Google's Gemini Pro model, Aura listens empathetically and provides responses tailored to the user's personality, using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) as a guide.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or newer
-   `ffmpeg`: A cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video. It is required by `pydub`. You can install it using a package manager like Homebrew (`brew install ffmpeg`) on macOS or Chocolatey (`choco install ffmpeg`) on Windows.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository** (or download the source code):
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/aura-chatbot.git](https://github.com/your-username/aura-chatbot.git)
    cd aura-chatbot
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    It's highly recommended to create a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.
    ```sh
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Install all the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file.
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up Your API Key**:
    Aura uses Streamlit's secrets management for the Gemini API Key.
    -   Create a folder named `.streamlit` in your project's root directory.
    -   Inside this folder, create a file named `secrets.toml`.
    -   Add your Gemini API key to this file as shown below:
    ```toml
    # .streamlit/secrets.toml
    GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Once the setup is complete, you can run the Streamlit application with the following command in your terminal:

```sh
streamlit run app.py
